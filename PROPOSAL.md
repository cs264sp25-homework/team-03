# Project Proposal

Chrome extension that creates an intelligent assistant powered by your browser tabs. By understanding the content across all open tabs, TabAssist provides a conversational interface that can synthesize information, answer questions, and help users make connections across multiple sources of information. This tool transforms how users interact with multiple browser tabs during research, shopping, or general browsing activities.
